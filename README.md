The app uses an object-oriented approach with classes and interfaces to manage tasks and render them on the page. 
The app is structured into two main files: app.ts and index.html. app.ts contains the TypeScript code for the app, including classes and interfaces for tasks and task lists. index.html contains the HTML markup and references to the app's CSS.
